const String chapterFive = '''The Smritis are a body of Hindu texts that provide guidelines on law, ethics, and social duties. Unlike the Vedas, which are considered divine revelations (Shruti), the Smritis are human compositions and are thus classified as secondary scriptures.

These texts evolved over time and served as practical manuals for social conduct, family life, religious practices, and governance. They aimed to establish order and harmony within society, particularly in terms of moral duties (dharma) and justice.

The Smritis are especially known for codifying laws related to caste duties (varna dharma), daily conduct, civil and criminal justice, and family law, forming the foundation of the Dharmaśāstra tradition (the science of righteousness).

Manusmriti (Laws of Manu):

One of the most influential and widely studied Smritis, the Manusmriti, is often considered the earliest Dharmaśāstra (legal treatise).

Attributed to Sage Manu, it is believed to date back to the 2nd century BCE to the 3rd century CE.

The Manusmriti is a comprehensive guide on dharma, covering topics such as:

Caste duties (varna dharma): It lays out the roles and responsibilities of the four primary castes (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras), reinforcing the idea that each caste has specific duties to perform in society. For instance, Brahmins are tasked with teaching and performing religious rituals, while Kshatriyas are protectors and warriors.

Daily conduct: It prescribes ethical conduct for individuals, such as truthfulness, non-violence, purity, and restraint.

Stages of life (ashramas): The Manusmriti details the four stages of life (Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, and Sannyasa) and the duties associated with each.

Civil and criminal law: The text provides rules for inheritance, property rights, trade, marriage, and punishment for various crimes, thus serving as a legal code.

Gender roles: The Manusmriti outlines the roles of women, often placing them in subordinate positions relative to men, but also stressing the importance of protecting and honoring women.

Despite its conservative views on caste and gender, the Manusmriti has significantly shaped the socio-legal framework of ancient Hindu society and continues to influence certain religious practices today.

Yajnavalkya Smriti:

The Yajnavalkya Smriti is another important legal and moral code, likely composed between the 1st and 4th centuries CE.
Named after the sage Yajnavalkya, this Smriti is more focused on practical law than philosophical or religious teachings, making it highly influential in shaping later Hindu law.

It is divided into three parts:

Achara: This section deals with proper conduct, rituals, and the duties of individuals at different stages of life. It outlines the ethical obligations of individuals in society, including duties toward family, community, and the gods.

Vyavahara: This part is primarily concerned with civil law, addressing issues such as property, debt, inheritance, contracts, marriage, and commerce. It also includes rules for judicial procedures, outlining how judges should resolve disputes and the punishments for various offenses.

Prayaschitta: This section focuses on expiation and penance, detailing the various ways to atone for sins and misdeeds. It describes different forms of penance (tapas) depending on the severity of the crime and the caste of the individual.

The Yajnavalkya Smriti was more progressive in some respects, as it reduced the emphasis on caste-based penalties and promoted a more consistent approach to justice. It also significantly influenced later texts like the Mitakshara, a major commentary on Hindu law.

Narada Smriti:

The Narada Smriti, attributed to the sage Narada, focuses primarily on the administration of justice and the legal system.

Dating from around the 5th century CE, this Smriti is notable for its emphasis on judicial procedures and its relatively secular approach to law.

Narada’s Smriti deals extensively with:

Legal disputes: It offers detailed guidance on how courts should handle disputes, particularly in civil matters such as debt, inheritance, and property.

Judicial procedures: The Narada Smriti outlines the qualifications of judges, witnesses, and the steps required to adjudicate cases fairly. It emphasizes the role of evidence and witness testimony in resolving legal matters.

Punishments: While it prescribes different punishments based on the severity of offenses, the Narada Smriti is more lenient compared to Manusmriti, especially in cases involving caste.

Mercantile law: Reflecting the growing importance of trade in this period, the Narada Smriti also covers laws related to commerce, contracts, partnerships, and debt recovery.

It was particularly influential in shaping legal practices in Hindu courts, given its practical focus on resolving disputes rather than on ritual purity or caste duties.


Significance of Smritis:

The Smritis played a crucial role in regulating social order, upholding religious and moral values, and codifying laws that governed Hindu society for centuries.

They were adaptable texts, revised and interpreted over time by different commentators, enabling them to remain relevant in changing socio-political contexts.

Although these texts emphasize caste distinctions and often place women in subordinate roles, they were also instrumental in establishing systems of governance and justice that influenced Hindu law up until modern times.

In modern India, many of the practices described in the Smritis have been reformed or set aside in favor of more egalitarian principles, but their historical and cultural influence endures.''';
